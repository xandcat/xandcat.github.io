                <p>Hi, welcome to my webpage! </p>
                <p>My name is Alexandra and I am a junior Computer Science Major at Bridgewater State University.
                    I spent some time at Massachusetts College of Art and Design as a Graphic Design major but 
                    changed paths, and I hope to merge my passions for design and programming in the future. </p>
